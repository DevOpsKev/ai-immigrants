# AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here!

What if artificial intelligence isn’t just a tool—but a kind of immigrant? Not human, but present. Not alive, but working. Not from another country, but from another kind of place.

This book frames A.I. as the newest foreign presence in our world—quietly taking jobs, reshaping culture, and provoking fear. In ten sharp, provocative chapters, *AI Immigrants* explores our deepest hopes and anxieties about automation, creativity, control, and the meaning of being human.

From job loss to cultural displacement, synthetic elites to data borders, this is a civic-minded, conversational, and humanist guide to a future that’s already arriving. It’s not about the machines. It’s about us.

Warm, witty, and unsettling in equal measure, this book is for anyone wondering: What happens when intelligence arrives—without a body, without a passport, and without asking permission?
