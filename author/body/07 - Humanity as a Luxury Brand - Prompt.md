> ------
>
> **GOAL**
>  Explore how, in the age of artificial intelligence, *being human* is becoming a premium commodity.

>
> ------
>
> **OPENING HOOK (MANDATORY)**
>  Start with a metaphor like:
>
> > *In a world of deepfakes, bots, and generated everything, “real” is the new luxury.
> >  Handwritten letters. Human customer service. Children raised without screens.

>
> ------

>
> 1. **The New Premium: Being Human**
>     “Authentic” is now a selling point. In-person events. Analog tools. AI-free art.
>     Humanity is no longer assumed—it’s curated.
>
> 2. **Digital Serfdom vs Elite Protection**
>     The wealthy shield their children from screens, social media, and surveillance.
>     Everyone else is algorithmically nudged, emotionally farmed, and trained to swipe.
>
>    > The working class is optimized. The ruling class is offline.
>
> 3. **Humanity Becomes a Brand**

>
> 4. **The Algorithmic Class System**
>     Most of the world—human or synthetic—is now in service to algorithms: scoring content, feeding engagement, keeping up with the feed.
>
> 5. **The Outsourced Soul**
>     Content moderation, chatbot tuning, AI alignment—all rely on human labor hidden behind the curtain.
>     Like domestic workers in mansions: visible only when something goes wrong.
>
