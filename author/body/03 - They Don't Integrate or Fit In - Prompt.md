# Prompt for Chapter 3: *They Don't Integrate or Fit In*

**TASK**\
Write a full chapter titled **"They Don't Integrate or Fit In"** for the
nonfiction book *AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here!*

**TARGET LENGTH**: 4,000--4,500 words

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GOAL

-   Accessible narrative nonfiction for informed but non-technical
    readers.\
-   Conversational but serious tone, like a trusted friend explaining
    something urgent.\
-   Ethically grounded---focus on human impact, accountability, and
    democratic stakes.\
-   Frame AI as a *new species of immigrant*---explore anxieties and
    hopes through the metaphor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STRUCTURE

### Hook (mandatory)

-   Begin with a bold, memorable line/metaphor: AI feels profoundly
    alien, not because it fails to integrate, but because we
    anthropomorphize it and expect it to "think like us."\
-   Open with something punchy and unsettling---like: *"An AI doesn't
    misfit because it's foreign. It misfits because it was never human
    in the first place."*

### Sections (\~6--8)

1.  **Speaking a Foreign Language** -- How AI outputs feel like verdicts
    in an alien tongue. Draw parallel with immigrant "language barrier"
    stigma.\
2.  **The Black Box Courtroom** -- The opacity problem: people live with
    consequences but can't see the reasoning.\
3.  **The Perfect Sociopath** -- Why AI can simulate empathy yet feel
    empty, and why this makes it powerful but dangerous.\
4.  **Anthropomorphizing the Alien** -- How humans project emotions and
    intent onto systems that don't have them.\
5.  **Design Responsibility** -- Developers as cultural interpreters. If
    AI is an alien, its creators act as translators and must be held
    accountable.\
6.  **Bridges, Not Walls** -- Explainability tools, transparency
    standards, and human oversight as integration policies.\
7.  **Rethinking Integration** -- Societies integrate by rules and
    expectations, not by hoping the alien becomes human. Same for AI.\
8.  **Reflection/Close** -- The problem isn't that AI doesn't "fit
    in"---it's that we haven't demanded the right frameworks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## STYLE & TONE

-   Short to medium paragraphs, each carrying one clear idea.\
-   Vary rhythm: some urgent, some reflective.\
-   Use metaphors (foreign language, courtroom, masks) instead of
    overused employment examples.\
-   Plain English, avoid jargon; explain terms with analogy if needed.\
-   Ethical reflection at the end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## REPETITION RULES

-   **Avoid overusing the "AI decides who gets a job" example.** If
    employment is mentioned, take a new angle (e.g., visa approval,
    medical triage, credit scoring).\
-   Do not recycle metaphors or anecdotes used in previous chapters
    unless reframed in a new light.\
-   Strive for novelty: deepen analysis instead of restating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT

-   Write in **Markdown** with clear headings and subheadings.\
-   Flesch Reading Ease \> 60.\
-   End with a thought-provoking reflection.
