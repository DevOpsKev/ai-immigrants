  Draft Chapter 6: *“They Bring Crime and Disorder”* into my scaffolded sections.

  Requirements:
  - Weave **serious harms** (human rights violations, crimes against humanity, copyright/IP expropriation).
  - Cover **AI scams**, **AI-assisted hacking/cybercrime**, **identity theft**, **privacy violations**, and **algorithmic coercion** (violence, self-harm, extremism).
  - Expose **vendor/company opacity** as a structural driver of harm.
  - Balance fear with fact: name the **human decision-makers and incentives**.
  - Use a **narrative nonfiction voice**; short/medium paragraphs; maintain **Flesch > 60** readability.
  - Add **in-text cues** for where citations will be needed (e.g., “[REF: predictive policing study]”) without fabricating sources.

  Output:
  Return a **cohesive chapter draft** that fills the provided scaffold headings, with `[REF: …]` markers where evidence will be inserted.
