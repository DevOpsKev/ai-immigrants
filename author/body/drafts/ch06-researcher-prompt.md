User:
Scan `author/body/drafts/ch06-narator-researcher-draft-#1`. For every `[REF: …]` marker:

1. Propose 2–3 **credible, recent sources** (peer-reviewed, reputable journalism, NGO/government reports).  
2. Format in **APA 7th edition**.  
3. Provide a **1-sentence relevance note**.  
4. Include a **short quote, stat, or data point** suitable for integration into the text.  
5. If no reliable source can be found, write: *“Needs verification.”* — do not fabricate.

Output:
Return a clean, grouped list of references by `[REF: …]` marker.  
Do **not** rewrite the chapter — only provide citations, notes, and quotes.
