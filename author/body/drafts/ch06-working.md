# Chapter 6 — They Bring Crime and Disorder

## The hook: Crime with a borrowed face
<!-- Vivid open: deepfake voice of a loved one; false confession video; debt in your name. 1–3 short grafs. -->

## Serious harm, not sci-fi
<!-- Human rights violations; surveillance/predictive policing; authoritarian uses; copyright/IP expropriation. Where responsibility sits. -->

## Everyday criminality at scale
<!-- Voice-clone scams, phishing factories, disinfo mills; botnets + automation. -->

## Hacking, cracking, and crime-as-a-service
<!-- AI-assisted intrusion, password cracking, malware generation, toolchains. -->

## Your face, my debt: identity theft and privacy erosion
<!-- Deepfake IDs, KYC bypass, synthetic identities, data broker pipelines. -->

## Coercion engines: from outrage to self-harm
<!-- Algorithmic amplification of extremism; youth mental health; targeted nudging. -->

## The architecture of opacity
<!-- Black-box models, secret datasets, NDAs, vendor capture, “safety by secrecy.” -->

## Who profits, who pays
<!-- Follow the money; externalities on citizens; legal costs; enforcement gaps. -->

## Not a scapegoat, not a savior
<!-- Tool vs use; immigrant metaphor nuance; regulation, oversight, redress. -->

## Closing reflection
<!-- One strong paragraph that ties back to the hook and the democratic stakes. -->
