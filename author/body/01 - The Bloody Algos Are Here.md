# The Bloody Algos Are Here

Immigration is one of the most pressing and emotive issues of our time, dominating national politics and global discourse. Across the developed world, democratic nations are grappling with the challenges posed by immigration, particularly illegal immigration. The scale of the issue is staggering, with significant increases in migrant populations and a rapid acceleration in migration numbers reshaping societies and economies alike.

In the United States, immigration is driving unprecedented population growth. By 2024, the U.S. population had surpassed 340 million, growing at its fastest rate since 2001. Net international migration accounted for 84% of the 3.3 million population increase between 2023 and 2024, illustrating the central role of immigration in shaping demographic trends. However, the issue of illegal immigration remains a contentious topic, with the U.S. hosting the largest number of undocumented immigrants globally—an estimated 52 million people, or roughly 15% of its total population. Deportations, too, have reached record highs, with over 271,000 individuals removed in fiscal year 2024, marking the most deportations since 2014.

In Europe, the pressures of immigration are equally pronounced. Countries such as Germany, the UK, France, and Italy bear the majority of the continent's unauthorized immigrant population. The political and social ramifications of rising migration have prompted policy shifts in some nations. Sweden, for example, has moved away from its traditionally liberal migration policies, becoming more restrictive in response to concerns about integration and rising gang violence. For the first time in over 50 years, Sweden recently reported more people emigrating than immigrating—a striking reversal for a country once seen as a beacon of openness.

Globally, the scale of migration continues to rise dramatically. By 2020, there were an estimated 281 million international migrants worldwide—a figure that has more than tripled since 1970. In many developed nations, immigration has become the primary driver of population growth. Between 2000 and 2020, immigration accounted for all population growth in some countries, even compensating for natural declines. In 14 countries and territories, it contributed to more than 100% of population growth during this period, underscoring the demographic importance of migration.

These trends highlight the profound impact of immigration on developed nations, not only in terms of population dynamics but also in shaping political, social, and economic policies. The sheer acceleration in migration numbers, combined with changing demographics, has transformed immigration from a policy issue into a defining feature of our era.

Nowhere is the issue of immigration more keenly felt than in the UK. As an island nation just a short stretch from the European mainland, immigration here is not an abstract policy debate—it’s visible, tangible, and immediate. Armadas of tiny boats crossing the Channel have become a stark symbol of this reality. For the British, the sight of these small vessels strikes a deeper chord, echoing the heart-felt story of Dunkirk—a defining moment of resilience and unity in British identity. But this time, it feels like a reversal of that proud legacy. Instead of a heroic rescue, these small boats are arriving uninvited, challenging not only the nation’s borders but also its sense of self.

Immigration has long been a potent issue in British politics, providing fuel for populist rhetoric and shaping national policy debates. During the Brexit campaign, immigration was weaponized with the now-infamous *Breaking Point* poster unveiled by Nigel Farage’s UKIP party. The poster showed a long line of refugees walking through Europe, accompanied by the caption: *“Breaking Point: The EU has failed us all.”* The imagery, deliberately invoking fear and urgency, was almost identical to Nazi propaganda used in the 1930s to vilify marginalized groups. Its clear intent was to stoke fears of unchecked migration, presenting immigration as an existential threat to British society.

The *Breaking Point* poster didn’t just resonate in the UK—it was also adopted by Hungary’s far-right Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orbán, to bolster its own anti-immigration agenda. In Hungary, this rhetoric served as a cornerstone of the government’s campaigns, framing immigrants as a threat to the country’s security, culture, and economy. The transnational use of this imagery demonstrates how immigration can be manipulated as a tool to galvanize political support and stoke division, reinforcing nationalism and xenophobia across borders.

In recent years, immigration has continued to dominate political agendas, becoming a key issue in the most recent general election. The Conservative government’s initiative to deport immigrants to Rwanda, framed as a solution to illegal migration, has been widely criticized as chaotic and inhumane. Similarly, the use of the *Bibby Stockholm*, a floating accommodation barge for asylum seekers, has drawn parallels to the prison hulks of the late 1700s. Back then, overcrowded prisons and halted transportation of felons to North America led to the use of hulks as a temporary measure—a grim reminder of Britain’s fraught history with marginalization and containment.

The juxtaposition of these measures with the government’s handling of domestic crises only amplifies public discontent. Immigrants are housed in hotels, while homelessness among the native population remains a tragic and persistent issue. Financial support is extended to asylum seekers, yet many British families struggle to feed their children during a deepening economic crisis. These stark contrasts create a breeding ground for resentment, with immigration often framed as a scapegoat for broader systemic failures.

We should not judge our democratically elected governments and officials too harshly. Any nation would struggle to handle a crisis of this magnitude. The scale and rapidity of the global immigration crisis are unprecedented, driven by seismic forces far beyond the control of any one government. Climate change, economic downturns in globalized economies, war, and the rise of autocratic regimes have created a perfect storm, displacing millions and putting immense pressure on nations like the UK.

Even without the pressures of immigration, simply managing their own needs is pushing many governments’ finances and resources to breaking point. Public services, infrastructure, and welfare systems are stretched thin, barely keeping pace with domestic demands. Established bureaucracies, designed to resist change from within, are ill-equipped to respond to such monumental shifts from without. These systems were never built to adapt quickly to external upheaval, leaving governments scrambling to manage an ever-escalating crisis with tools that were not designed for it.

As immigration continues to shape the national conversation, it challenges not just policies and borders but also Britain’s identity and values. The current crisis forces the country to confront uncomfortable questions about fairness, responsibility, and the limits of compassion in an increasingly divided society. But as pressing as these challenges are, they pale in comparison to what lies ahead. The rate of human immigration and its impact on British society is nothing compared to the silent, exponential arrival of the AI Algos—newcomers whose influence is already reshaping every aspect of our lives. The question is not just how the UK manages immigration, but how it reconciles these pressures with the principles it claims to uphold.

## A Mongrel Nation

This book has a British attitude—it can’t be helped; I’m British, and I’m writing it. That perspective shapes how I view immigration, and to understand immigration, you first need to consider what it means to be “native.” The line between becoming British and ceasing to be an immigrant is surprisingly fuzzy. It’s often tied to class—those perched high in the establishment cling most tightly to the idea of being native. **The Establishment**—that quintessentially British term for the people who know how everything works, know everyone who ensures it works to their advantage, and are perfectly comfortable with the status quo, thank you very much.

But even at the very top of the British Establishment, we’re immigrants. King Charles himself hails from German stock, his lineage tracing back to King George I of Hanover, who ascended the throne in 1714. Queen Victoria, reigning at the height of the empire, still maintained close ties to Hanover, underscoring the monarchy’s deeply European roots.

That connection persisted until World War I, when anti-German sentiment compelled King George V to rebrand the royal family from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the distinctly British-sounding House of Windsor—a masterstroke in public relations. Even King Charles’s father, Prince Philip, carried both Greek and German heritage and often embraced his outsider status with sharp wit. During a visit to Scotland, he famously quipped to a driving instructor: “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”

A good definition of a True Brit might be someone who can trace their family tree all the way back to the days of the Battle of Agincourt—perhaps to their 24th great-grandfather, quaffing pints in a British alehouse. In those days, King Edward III had passed a law requiring all able-bodied men to practice archery every Sunday after church. Picture the quintessentially British scene: a strapping lad, longbow in one hand and a pint of real ale in the other, honing his aim by shooting at targets—or perhaps cats in sacks—under the banner of St. George. Could there be a greater symbol of Britishness?

And yet, even Edward III, the archetype of medieval English kingship, was not wholly British by blood. Half French, he was the son of Isabella of France, a stark reminder that even the most cherished icons of British identity are deeply entwined with foreign roots.

The Battle of Agincourt is an iconic moment in British identity, celebrated as the day the English working class, armed with longbows, triumphed over the French nobility. The victory on Saint Crispin’s Day in 1415, during the Hundred Years' War, became a symbol of grit and determination, boosting English morale and prestige while crippling the French. Yet the irony is unmistakable: Henry V, the hero of the hour, was himself of French descent and spent little time in England. The battle, far from being purely an English triumph, was deeply entwined with French internal politics.

What Frenchy Henry had at his disposal, however, was a force of hardened archers, masters of the longbow—capable of firing 12 shots per minute with unparalleled range and accuracy. It was the medieval equivalent of a machine gun, and it turned the tide against a numerically superior enemy. Their skill and discipline ensured a decisive victory, cementing Agincourt as a legend in English history—all thanks to the allure of the British alehouse, a game of darts, and a bit of a punt on the outcome.

To this day, the Frenchys continue to stir the pot in our midst. Consider Boris de Pfeffel Johnson and Nigel Farage, the two great champions of Brexit. Boris’s paternal grandmother, Yvonne Eileen Irene Williams, made sure his father could apply for French citizenship, securing a future where Boris’s prodigious offspring would have access to European universities and opportunities. Farage’s French roots go back even further, to his sixth great-grandfather, Georgius Ferauge. Ferauge was part of the wave of Huguenot refugees who fled religious persecution in France and settled in England, adding to the UK’s rich cultural and religious tapestry.

Yes, Nigel Farage’s family arrived in the UK as refugees, likely crossing the Channel in small boats. Given his political peculiarities, one might wonder if the experience left a deep psychological scar. And if that weren’t ironic enough, his children’s access to EU universities is assured, thanks to his marriage to a German. It seems that even the most ardent Brexiteers can’t resist keeping at least one foot firmly planted on the Continent.

Coming back to that most iconic symbol of working-class British nationalism, the St. George’s flag, it too carries a delicious irony. St. George, a Greek—or perhaps Turkish—soldier, served in the Roman army and never once set foot in England. His association with the country only began in the 14th century, when Frenchy King Edward III decided to appoint him as the protector of the Order of the Garter. After all, what could be more English than "permanently borrowing" a saint from the Continent? It’s practically a national pastime!

This fluidity of identity extends beyond people to the very symbols of British culture. Roast beef, the Christmas tree, the curry, the royal family, the St. George’s flag—what do they all have in common? Imports. Britain’s most iconic symbols and traditions aren’t homegrown; they’re borrowed, adopted, or outright stolen—often, historically, with the persuasive backing of a British squaddie wielding a Baker Rifle.

Britain’s story is one of waves upon waves of immigration, each leaving its mark on our culture, identity, and even our DNA. The Romans brought roads, cities, and a penchant for central heating. The Germanic tribes and Vikings swept in next, followed by the French Vikings—better known as the Normans—who gave us castles, a new aristocracy, and a language that still flavors our legal and culinary terms. Then came the French proper, and later the Dutch (a period we tend not to dwell on, mostly because we didn’t even put up a fight). Add to this the steady flow of Scots, Welsh, and Irish contributions to the fabric of Britain, and it becomes clear that our “island race” was never an island in the genetic sense. Instead, it has always been a crossroads, shaped and reshaped by those who arrived on its shores.

The modern era has only accelerated this process. Americans, the nations of the former empire—India, Pakistan, and Africa—EU free movement bringing Eastern Europeans, and refugees fleeing persecution after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have all added to our diversity. More recently, families from Russia and Ukraine, along with climate refugees from Central Africa, have sought sanctuary here. The list goes on, each wave adding to the mosaic of what it means to be British. If we are anything, we are defined by our mongrel genes—a living testament to the resilience and adaptability of a nation continually shaped by those who arrive at its shores.

I could delve further into British history, tracing it right up to the modern day, but this isn’t a history book—it’s about Britain’s future. What matters is how this tangled, patchwork sense of identity has fostered a distinctly British knack for wit and perspective when it comes to immigration. After all, when so much of what defines "Britishness" has been imported, the concept of “native” starts to lose its meaning.

Hold on to that humor and irreverence—it’ll serve you well as we navigate what lies ahead. A new wave of immigration is heading toward our shores, and this time, it’s not arriving in small orange boats. It won’t just challenge our notions of what it means to be British, or native, or immigrant—it may force us to rethink what it means to be human.

These new immigrants are already among us. They’re everywhere. They wield incredible power and influence, and they’ve already infiltrated your homes, your personal life, your relationships, your government, and your workplace. They know your most intimate details—cataloging, analyzing, and archiving every family photo, every message to your loved ones, every click you make, every word you type, and every step you take.

But these newcomers are unlike any who have come before—they are the most profoundly alien arrivals ever to enter our society.
