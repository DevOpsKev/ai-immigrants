This book has a British attitude—it can’t be helped; I’m British, and I’m writing it. That perspective shapes how I view immigration, and to understand immigration, you first need to consider what it means to be “native.” The line between becoming British and ceasing to be an immigrant is surprisingly fuzzy. It’s often tied to class—those perched high in the establishment cling most tightly to the idea of being native. **The Establishment**—that quintessentially British term for the people who know how everything works, know everyone who ensures it works to their advantage, and are perfectly comfortable with the status quo, thank you very much.

But even at the very top of the British Establishment, we’re immigrants. King Charles himself hails from German stock, his lineage tracing back to King George I of Hanover, who ascended the throne in 1714. Queen Victoria, reigning at the height of the empire, still maintained close ties to Hanover, underscoring the monarchy’s deeply European roots.

That connection persisted until World War I, when anti-German sentiment compelled King George V to rebrand the royal family from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the distinctly British-sounding House of Windsor—a masterstroke in public relations. Even King Charles’s father, Prince Philip, carried both Greek and German heritage and often embraced his outsider status with sharp wit. During a visit to Scotland, he famously quipped to a driving instructor: “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”

The malleability of national identity isn’t confined to the monarchy. One of the most iconic symbols of working class British nationalism, the St. George’s flag, carries a similar irony. St. George, a Greek—or perhaps Turkish—soldier, served in the Roman army and never set foot in England. His association with the country began in the 14th century, when Edward III made him the protector of the Order of the Garter. Even Edward III himself, the archetype of medieval English kingship, was the son of a French mother, Isabella of France.

This fluidity extends beyond people to the very symbols of British culture. Roast beef, the Christmas tree, the curry, the royal family, the St. George’s flag—what do they all have in common? Imports. Britain’s most iconic symbols and traditions aren’t homegrown; they’re borrowed, adopted, or outright stolen—often, historically, with the persuasive backing of a British squaddie wielding a Royal Enfield rifle.

I could delve further into British history, tracing it right up to the modern day, but this isn’t a history book—it’s about Britain’s future. What matters is how this tangled, patchwork sense of identity has fostered a distinctly British knack for wit and perspective when it comes to immigration. After all, when so much of what defines "Britishness" has been imported, the concept of “native” starts to lose its meaning.

Hold on to that humor and irreverence—it’ll serve you well as we navigate what lies ahead. A new wave of immigration is heading toward our shores, and this time, it’s not arriving in small orange boats. It won’t just challenge our notions of what it means to be British, or native, or immigrant—it may force us to rethink what it means to be human.

These new immigrants are already among us. They’re everywhere. They wield incredible power and influence, and they’ve already infiltrated your homes, your personal life, your relationships, your government, and your workplace. They know your most intimate details—cataloging, analyzing, and archiving every family photo, every message to your loved ones, every click you make, every word you type, and every step you take.

But these newcomers are unlike any who have come before—they are the most profoundly alien arrivals ever to enter our society.
