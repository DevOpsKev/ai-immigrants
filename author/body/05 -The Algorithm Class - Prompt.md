> **TASK**
>  Write a full chapter titled **“The Algorithm Class”** for the nonfiction book *AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here*.
>
> **TARGET LENGTH**: 3,000–3,500 words
>
> ------
>
> **GOAL**
>  Investigate how artificial intelligence is enabling the rise of a new elite—an **algorithmic ruling class** that is:
>
> - Invisible to the public
> - Unaccountable to law or democratic institutions
> - Hyper-optimized for profit and control
>
> Draw comparisons to historical elites (aristocracy, clergy, tech plutocrats) and show how A.I. is their new instrument. This class is no longer human-only—it includes **non-human agents** that exert real power: automated systems, opaque models, autonomous actors managing labor, capital, and perception.

> ------
>
> **TONE & VOICE**
>
> - Observant, sharp, quietly outraged
> - As if revealing something the reader already suspects but hasn’t yet fully named
> - Conversational with a civic backbone—clarity over cynicism
>
> ------
>
> **STYLE & STRUCTURE GUIDELINES**
>
> - **Hook:** Start with a powerful image or metaphor (e.g., "They don’t wear robes or crowns. They wear nothing. You can’t see them—but you obey them.")
> - Develop 4–6 core ideas, each in its own section
> - Short paragraphs, mix of short punchy lines and reflective passages
> - Build tension through evidence, then offer synthesis or reflection
> - Close with a challenge to the reader’s sense of power, class, and complicity

> **INTEGRATE THESE THEMES**
>
> 1. **The Emergence of a Post-Human Elite**
>     A class made not only of billionaires—but of the systems they own. AI agents now execute power at scale, with minimal oversight and no empathy.
> 2. **Opaque Power**
>     Algorithms determine credit, parole, promotion, pricing, visibility, content, reputation. Most operate without appeal.
> 3. **The New Class War Is Silent**
>     This isn’t rich vs poor—it’s **computable vs human**. You’re either in the loop or part of the dataset.
> 4. **Automation as a Gatekeeper**
>     You’re not rejected by a person—you’re rejected by a logic function. And no one knows what it was optimizing for.
> 5. **The Algos Don’t Work for You**
>     They serve whoever pays them. And increasingly, they are not just tools—they are **policy**.
> 6. **Digital Serfdom**
>     Workers are gamified, tracked, nudged, and scored—like livestock in a system they can’t see and didn’t vote for.
> 7. **The Fantasy of Neutrality**
>     “It’s just math.” But the math encodes values—ones we didn’t choose and don’t examine.

> **RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS**
>
> - Include **current (2024–2025)** examples of A.I. decision-making and power dynamics, from:
>   - HR screening algorithms
>   - Predictive policing & parole systems
>   - Social media recommendation systems
>   - AI-managed gig work & warehouse labor
>   - AI in finance, insurance, healthcare
>   - OpenAI board drama, Google DeepMind research, Meta’s algorithmic governance, etc.
> - Cite studies, news investigations, or leaked policy documents where useful (APA-style).
