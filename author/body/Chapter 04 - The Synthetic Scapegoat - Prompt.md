> ------
>
> **GOAL**
>  Argue that artificial intelligence is being used as a scapegoat to absorb public blame for systemic problems actually caused by corporate, political, and social forces. Reveal how A.I. has become a convenient fall guy—while a rising class of corporate actors uses it to insulate themselves from democratic accountability. Address how A.I.-powered platforms foster division, learned helplessness, and cultural self-loathing, while society distracts itself by blaming the tech itself rather than those who wield it.

> **INTEGRATE THESE CORE THEMES**
>
> 1. **The Perfect Fall Guy** – A.I. can’t vote, protest, or sue. Corporations use it as a shield for decisions they don't want to own.
> 2. **Bias as a Mirror, Not a Virus** – A.I. reflects our cultural and systemic biases; it didn’t create them.
> 3. **Blame the Model, Not the Mogul** – “The algorithm” becomes a scapegoat for human decisions rooted in profit, not justice.
> 4. **The Rise of the Post-Democratic Class** – A data-rich elite is emerging, operating outside traditional democratic checks.
> 5. **Social Media and Learned Helplessness** – A.I.-driven platforms amplify division and numbness; users blame the feed instead of the business model.
> 6. **We Sleepwalked Into This** – Our collective apathy and hunger for convenience helped build this system. Now we act surprised it governs us.
>
> ------
