# Agentic Prompt – Chapter 8

**TASK**
 Write **Chapter 8 — “They’re Here Illegally or Unfairly”** for *AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here!*

**TARGET LENGTH**: 4,000–4,500 words

------

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Before drafting**, review project docs for tone, style, and consistency:
   - `writers-guide.md` – voice, tone, structure.
   - `editorial-guide.md` – grammar, style, APA referencing.
   - `AI_Immigrants_Chapter_Outline.md` – scope and framing of this chapter.
2. **Check the GitHub repo containing previous chapters in directory** './author/body/markdown':
   - Identify themes, metaphors, and examples already used.
   - Avoid duplication (e.g., don’t repeat arguments already covered elsewhere).
   - Ensure stylistic and thematic consistency across the manuscript.
   - Subtly echo earlier chapters if useful, but don’t recycle content.
3. Then draft the chapter according to the structure below.

------

## VOICE & TONE

- Accessible narrative nonfiction.
- Conversational but serious; warm and civic-minded.
- Treat the reader as an affected citizen, not an abstract observer.
- Avoid academic coldness; focus on clarity and human examples.

------

## STYLE & FORMATTING

- Use **American English** and **APA referencing** where citing sources.
- Markdown with H2 subheadings in **sentence case**.
- Short paragraphs (one idea each).
- Mix sentence rhythms (punchy + reflective).
- End sections with insights, reflections, or questions.
- Aim for **Flesch Reading Ease > 60**.

------

## STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

- **Hook (mandatory):** A punchy opening line or metaphor (“They don’t arrive with papers, they arrive with servers…”).
- **7 sections** (≈500–650 words each):
  1. **The invasion without borders** – AI companies as entities richer than nations, moving faster than law.
  2. **Move fast, bend rules** – how they stretch or ignore laws until regulators catch up (and by then, it’s too late).
  3. **Data extraction economy** – “they came for our data, not our jobs,” emotional farming and vote-selling.
  4. **Queue-jumping and unfair advantage** – analogy of immigrants waiting years while AI cuts in line.
  5. **National policy vs borderless AI** – lawmakers underfunded and outgunned by trillion-dollar firms.
  6. **The human cost** – short vignettes of artists, citizens, or small businesses harmed by unfair data or platform practices.
  7. **From unfair entry to occupation** – the shift from illegality to permanence, foreshadowing *The AI Occupation*.
- **Close:** A sharp reflection — “What begins as unfair entry hardens into permanent presence. That is no longer immigration. That is occupation.”

## SCOPE & KEY TOPICS

- AI firms evading national jurisdiction.
- “Data colonialism” — extraction without consent.
- Lawmakers too slow, underfunded, or technically ill-equipped.
- Copyright and consent (art, books, music training sets).
- Facial recognition / justice system bias.
- Emotional manipulation and voter influence.
- The immigrant metaphor: queue-jumping, unfair advantage, law-bending.

------

## MANDATORY WRITING RULES

- Plain English; define technical terms with analogies.
- Avoid hype, cynicism, and sci-fi tropes.
- Explain mechanisms clearly — show who profits and who loses.
- Use reputable sources: peer-reviewed research, NGO/government reports, or major journalism.
- Provide APA-style references for 5+ important sources at the end.

------

## OUTPUT FORMAT

- Markdown.
- H2 subheadings for sections.
- Inline APA citations where necessary.
- End with:
  1. A 2–3 paragraph **civic checklist** (“what we can do”).
  2. One reflective **closing question**.
  3. Editorial note on sources used + APA reference list.
