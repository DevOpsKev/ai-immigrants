# Agentic Prompt – Chapter 5: They Overload Our Public Services

## TASK
Write a full chapter for the nonfiction book *AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here!*  

**TARGET LENGTH**: 4,000–4,500 words  

---

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Before drafting**, review the following project documents for tone, style, and consistency:
   - `writers-guide.md` – tone, structure, framing.  
   - `editorial-guide.md` – grammar, style, APA referencing.  
   - `AI_Immigrants_Chapter_Outline.md` – chapter themes and scope.  

2. **Check the GitHub repo containing previous chapters**:
   - Identify themes, metaphors, and examples already used.  
   - Avoid duplication (e.g., “AI decides who gets a job” is already covered elsewhere).  
   - Ensure stylistic and thematic consistency across the manuscript.  
   - Echo earlier chapters subtly if helpful, but without recycling content.  

3. Then draft Chapter 5 according to the structure below.  

---

## GOAL
- Accessible narrative nonfiction for informed but non-technical readers.  
- Conversational but serious tone, like a trusted friend explaining something urgent.  
- Ethically grounded—focus on human impact, accountability, and democratic stakes.  
- Frame AI as a *new species of immigrant*—use this metaphor to explore anxieties and hopes.

## STRUCTURE

### 1. Hook – *The Familiar Accusation*
- Open with a sharp line paralleling immigrant myths:  
  *“They clog our hospitals. They flood our schools. They strain welfare. We’ve heard it before—about immigrants. Now the charge is leveled at algorithms.”*  
- Establish suspicion: AI is accused of being a **burden** on already strained services.  
- Signal complexity: AI doesn’t flood services—it reconfigures them.

### 2. Healthcare on the Algorithm’s Clock
- **Promise vs reality**: Babylon Health, AI triage, diagnostics.  
- **Failures**: missed diagnoses, financial collapse, NHS costs.  
- Lesson: AI offers speed but risks blind spots.  
- Link to scapegoating: the deeper issue is chronic underfunding.

### 3. Automated Classrooms
- **Promises**: AI grading, tutoring, monitoring.  
- **Problems**: unfair grading, bias, parental mistrust.  
- **Hidden costs**: appeals, lawsuits, erosion of teacher autonomy.  
- Immigration parallel: outsiders blamed for “overloading” schools, when real problem is inadequate resources.

### 4. Welfare and Bureaucracy
- **Case study**: Robodebt (Australia)—automated cruelty at scale.  
- Billions wasted, people wrongly accused, public trust eroded.  
- The moral question: efficiency vs dignity.  
- Bureaucracy is already dehumanizing; AI magnifies it.

### 5. How AI Companies Leach Money
Explain patterns with short, vivid vignettes:
- **Consultancy capture** – agencies dependent on contractors.  
- **Pilot projects that never scale** – taxpayers fund showcases.  
- **Vendor lock-in** – perpetual license and upgrade fees.  
- **Efficiency that cuts service** – downstream costs of errors.  
- **Surveillance and data monetization** – subscriptions with little value.  
- **Revolving door politics** – advisory roles become sales funnels.  
- **No liability** – failures absorbed by taxpayers.  
- **Appeals and oversight costs** – crises pushed downstream.

### 6. The Real Overload
- AI doesn’t overload services—**governments offload responsibility** onto it.  
- The real overload is mistrust, inefficiency, and wasted money.  
- Analogy: blaming immigrants when policy decisions starve systems.

### 7. What Integration Should Look Like
- AI as a colleague, not a faceless authority.  
- Transparency, explainability, and human override.  
- Investment in public digital capacity—not just private contracts.  
- Reframe: AI doesn’t have to “flood” services if rules are democratically set.

### 8. Closing Reflection
- End on a civic, reflective note:  
  *“Hospitals, schools, welfare offices—these are where democracy touches flesh. If we allow machines to strip away compassion, we risk treating citizens as problems to be processed, not people to be served. The question isn’t whether AI overloads public services—it’s whether we let it overload our humanity.”*

## STYLE
- Use **metaphor and analogy** to make abstract ideas tangible.  
- Vary sentence rhythms—short and urgent, long and reflective.  
- Avoid jargon unless explained.  
- Keep paragraphs short-to-medium length.  
- Maintain readability: Flesch score > 60.  

---

## AVOID
- Repetition of examples already used in other chapters.  
- Overly technical jargon or corporate-speak.  
- Sci-fi tropes or hype.
