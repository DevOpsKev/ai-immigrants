# The AI Trilogy – Outline

This document outlines the structure and chapters for the three books in *The AI Trilogy*.

## Book 1: **AI Immigrants**

*"The Bloody Algos Are Here"*

Framing AI as a foreign presence—misunderstood, feared, exploited, and mythologized.

### Chapters:

1. **They’re Taking Our Jobs**
    Automation, displacement, and the age-old panic of being replaced.
2. **Over Here and Overpaid**
    Who really benefits from AI—and who’s paying the price?
3. **Ruining Our Culture**
    Machine-generated art, media, language, and belief.
4. **The Synthetic Scapegoat**
    Why we fear AI the way we’ve feared immigrants and outsiders for centuries.
5. **The Algorithm Class**
    A new elite: invisible, unaccountable, post-human.
6. **Sentience, Schm-entience**
    Intelligence vs consciousness—do we care, or just want results?
7. **Humanity as a Luxury Brand**
    What AI reveals about our own value.
8. **Build the Firewall**
    Borders for bots—data sovereignty, alignment, control fantasies.
9. **Who Owns the Future?**
    Data, wealth, and the slow privatization of cognition.
10. **You Are Not Redundant**
     Why this book was written—for humans, by one (allegedly).
