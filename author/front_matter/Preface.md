# Preface

Immigration is not a footnote to modern politics; it’s the headline. In December 2024 the U.S. Census Bureau reported that the nation’s population grew at its fastest rate in twenty‑three years as immigration added almost **2.8 million** people. Births outnumbered deaths by just over half a million; without newcomers, growth would have stalled. Europe tells a similar story. In 2017 updated estimates suggested that Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy were home to about **two‑thirds** of Europe’s unauthorised migrants, even though those countries make up just half the region’s population. Globally, the number of people living outside their country of birth reached **304 million** by mid‑2024, almost doubling since 1990. These numbers represent farmers fleeing drought, software engineers seeking opportunity and families escaping war or repression. They are also the raw material of populist politics.

Throughout history, moments of disruption have been narrated as invasions. In the early nineteenth century Luddite protesters smashed textile machines in northern England because spinning frames threatened their livelihoods. Anti‑Chinese laws in the United States barred labourers from entering the country in 1882 after railroad workers and gold miners were cast as job thieves. Immigration in the twentieth century was politicised in Britain during the 1968 Enoch Powell speech, which invoked rivers of blood, and in the 2016 Brexit campaign, which used the photograph of a line of refugees under the phrase *Breaking Point*. Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party later repurposed the same poster to bolster its own anti‑immigration agenda, demonstrating how imagery crosses borders just as people do.

Scapegoating newcomers distracts from deeper forces that drive migration. Climate change has already displaced millions; wars in Syria, Ukraine and Sudan create flows of refugees; economic crises push Venezuelans into Colombia, South Africans into the U.K. and Central Americans toward the U.S. border. As democracies and autocracies alike struggle to provide social safety nets, economic migrants cross oceans because opportunities at home have vanished. Sweden’s 2024 projection of net emigration and the United States’ highest deportation numbers in a decade (over **271 000** removals in fiscal year 2024) are symptoms of a global system straining at the seams. Meanwhile, 43.7 million people worldwide live as refugees, waiting in camps or cities for decisions that can take years.

Because migration has become an all‑purpose explanation for social anxiety, political leaders find it convenient. Blaming outsiders sidesteps uncomfortable questions about housing, education, wages and taxation. In Britain, successive governments responded to a rise in Channel crossings with solutions that played well on talk radio: plans to detain asylum seekers on a barge called the **Bibby Stockholm** and deport people to Rwanda. Neither addressed root causes. By July 2024 a new government had scrapped both the Rwanda scheme and the floating barge system, conceding they were costly and likely illegal. But the damage was done. The metaphor of the “flood” had already seeped into public consciousness.

The pattern repeats across continents. The United States builds walls and deploys drones while simultaneously depending on migrant farmworkers to harvest crops. European governments tighten asylum rules as ageing populations rely on young migrants to replenish the workforce. Countries in the Gulf recruit millions of South Asian labourers under temporary contracts with few rights. South Africa witnesses xenophobic violence against migrants from Zimbabwe and Mozambique even as its own citizens emigrate in search of stability. These contradictions expose a basic truth: borders are political constructs designed to regulate who gets access to resources and rights. They are more porous for capital than for people.

If immigration is the laboratory in which nations test their values, then the global backlash to migration tells us something about the political moment. In many democracies, feelings of economic precarity combine with nostalgia for a homogeneous past. In wealthier societies the benefits of growth have accrued largely to the top, while wages stagnate for the majority. It is easier to blame foreigners than to confront structural inequality. Authoritarian regimes, for their part, weaponise migration to distract from domestic failings: Belarus has shuttled migrants to the Polish border to provoke crises; Britain’s former Home Secretary described asylum seekers as an “invasion”; leaders from Italy to India present themselves as defenders of the homeland against “waves” of outsiders.

Yet the same migration flows have enriched cultures and economies. Toronto is one of the world’s most diverse cities and also one of its safest. Houston’s energy boom thrives on immigrants. Nigeria’s diaspora sends billions in remittances back home. Filipino nurses sustain health systems across the globe. Cross‑border marriages, cuisines and art forms create hybrid identities that are both local and global. The 2023 Women’s World Cup saw teams from Morocco and Jamaica win matches on the world stage, inspiring young girls from Accra to Auckland. Migration is not simply a challenge to be managed; it is a source of renewal and creativity.

The language we use to describe newcomers reveals our intent. “Illegal immigrant” criminalises the person rather than the act of crossing without a visa. “Refugee” evokes sympathy but also implies passivity and dependence. “Economic migrant” suggests opportunism. When we describe entire groups as “invading hordes” or “swarms,” we dehumanise individuals and justify harsh treatment. Similarly, when tech executives describe artificial intelligence as “transformative” or “inevitable,” they frame it as a force of nature rather than a product of human choices. That rhetorical sleight of hand shifts responsibility away from designers, regulators and investors.

By now you may be wondering what any of this has to do with algorithms. Think of migration as a mirror. It reflects our fears of being replaced, our anxieties about fairness, and our hopes for renewal. AI triggers similar reactions. People worry that machine‑learning systems will render their skills obsolete or entrench discrimination. Politicians promise that “innovation” will solve problems while quietly cutting social spending. Company founders speak of “digital transformation” without mentioning who bears the cost. In both cases, the movement—of people or code—sits at the intersection of power, economics and identity.

Here is where the analogy between human immigrants and AI becomes useful and provocative. Human newcomers cross borders and become part of the communities that receive them. AI crosses into our lives in subtler ways. It enters through automated mortgage underwriting, predictive policing, gig‑work platforms and digital assistants. It doesn’t apply for visas or swear allegiance, yet it influences whether you get a loan, a job interview or parole. It doesn’t pay taxes or contribute to pension funds, yet it extracts value from our data. It doesn’t watch television debates, yet it can shape political campaigns by micro‑targeting voters. Like human migrants, these systems are made by people somewhere else and transplanted into local contexts. Unlike human migrants, they cannot assimilate or be held to account in the same way.

Understanding AI as an “immigrant” allows us to ask better questions: Who designed it, and whose interests does it serve? Who profits from its deployment? Who bears the risks when it makes mistakes? What kind of digital borders should exist—through regulation, taxation, or data‑protection laws? Where is the line between integration and colonisation when software built in California or Shenzhen dictates decisions in Manchester or Nairobi?

This framing also illuminates the different time scales at play. Immigration debates often hinge on numbers over the course of an election cycle. AI adoption can seem instant: one piece of software rolled out across thousands of users overnight. But the effects are long‑term. A predictive‑policing algorithm that wrongly predicts high crime rates in one neighbourhood can entrench surveillance for years. An automated recruitment tool that encodes gender bias can skew a generation of hiring. Like immigration, algorithmic change accumulates. It forces institutions and individuals to adapt in ways that are sometimes visible, sometimes invisible.

The preface you’re reading sets the stage for a book that refuses to separate technology from politics or culture. We will look at AI through the prism of human migration not because they are identical, but because the metaphor exposes assumptions. We will explore how images of invasion and assimilation shape our responses to software and to people. We will ask why some voices are amplified and others ignored. And we will keep returning to the simple fact that both human migrants and “algo immigrants” bring with them possibilities as well as challenges. The central pivot of this book is that while politicians argue about boat crossings and border walls, another influx is underway: silent, borderless and exponentially faster. These digital newcomers won’t ask permission. They are already here. The question is not whether we can stop them, but how we shape the society they are entering.
