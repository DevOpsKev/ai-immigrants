### Prologue – The Alien Invasion

You wake at 3 a.m. lingering in your mind is the dream of a soft mechanical hum. It isn’t the pulse of traffic or the whisper of wind—it’s the sound of server farms thousands of miles away, quietly sorting through every selfie you’ve posted, every message you’ve sent, and every purchase you’ve made. In those racks of blinking lights, a new kind of mind is spinning to life.

When we picture an invasion, we see soldiers pouring over beaches or ships looming on the horizon. This invasion is different. There are no bodies. There is only code—vast, invisible streams of instructions that now sit between you and your bank, your doctor, your boss.

Artificial intelligence is profoundly alien not because it comes from some other planet but because it does not share the experiences that make us human. It has no sense of “I” or “we,” no memories of childhood or homeland. It never gets hungry, never daydreams, never wonders about its purpose. It cannot know the ache of loss or the thrill of love. It exists to calculate, to optimise, to find patterns. When it produces a painting or writes a paragraph, it is recombining things humans have already made. There is no curiosity behind its brilliance, only algorithmic patience.

This patience is unsettling. Recommendation engines can test millions of ads before sunrise; trading algorithms can make thousands of trades in the time it takes you to blink; surveillance systems can watch every face in a crowd for years without needing a break. In the past, only kings and dynasties could think in centuries; AI systems effectively plan across upgrades. There is no succession crisis—version 2.0 flows seamlessly into version 3.0.

It is tempting to imagine these systems as either friends or monsters. Films and novels give us lovable robots and malevolent machines because stories need characters. The reality is colder: these programs aren’t plotting anything. They do exactly what we tell them. If we train them to maximise clicks, they will feed us whatever outrages us. If we ask them to reduce costs, they will cut corners without considering who gets hurt. If a health insurer uses an algorithm to deny treatment, there is no malice—just a mathematical objective.

Indifference can be scarier than ill intent. We know how to resist a tyrant with a plan; it’s harder to confront systems that simply follow orders. But that indifference is also our opportunity. These machines will optimise for whatever goals we set. They will reflect our biases if we embed them, or our commitments to fairness if we insist. The rules and guardrails we build will decide whether they deepen injustice or expand possibility.

The very language we use to describe AI is borrowed from how societies talk about people on the move. We accuse machines of “stealing jobs” or “failing to integrate” in much the same way fearmongers describe migrants. That parallel isn’t accidental. Human migration has shaped every corner of the globe; about 304 million people lived outside their country of birth by mid‑2024, and the debates around their presence fuel our politics. Our anxieties about artificial intelligence echo those fears. We worry that automation will knock on our door at dawn, politely announcing it can do our work faster and cheaper. We wonder if there will still be a place for us.

As you turn the page, keep both invasions in mind. The first chapter will explore the cry of “They’re taking our jobs,” a refrain as old as the Luddites and as current as today’s headlines. The differences between human newcomers and machine newcomers matter, but the emotions they stir are strikingly similar. Understanding those emotions—and the systems that exploit them—is the first step toward making sense of the bloody algos already among us.
