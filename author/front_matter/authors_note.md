### Algo  
**(noun)**  
*ˈælɡəʊ*

A derogatory term for algorithms and artificial intelligence systems, often used to express fear, frustration, or resentment toward their perceived encroachment on human jobs, creativity, and decision-making. Rooted in mistrust and misunderstanding, "Algo" embodies the anxieties of a society grappling with rapid technological change.

#### Example Usage:
- "The bloody Algos are taking all the good jobs, and now they want to write poetry too!"  
- "If we let the Algos run everything, what’s left for humans to do?"

#### Characteristics:
1. **Scapegoating**: Used to blame AI for systemic issues such as unemployment or inequality, while ignoring the broader socioeconomic context.  
2. **Dehumanization**: Reduces AI systems to faceless threats, ignoring their potential for collaboration and augmentation.  
3. **Fear-Mongering**: Often accompanied by exaggerated claims about AI's capabilities or intentions.  

#### Cultural Context:
- Reflects the same resistance and prejudice historically faced by disruptive technologies or marginalized groups entering established spaces.
- Popularized in casual, hyperbolic critiques of automation and AI's growing role in society.

### Algoism

**(noun)**  
*ˈælɡəʊɪzəm*

The prejudice, discrimination, or systemic bias directed toward algorithms and artificial intelligence systems, often stemming from fear, misunderstanding, or mistrust of their capabilities, roles, or influence in society.

#### Example Usage:
- "The company was accused of algoism when it rejected the use of AI-driven solutions despite their proven efficiency."
- "Algoism can hinder technological progress by perpetuating unfounded fears about automation and AI."

#### Characteristics of Algoism:
1. **Fear of Automation**: Resistance to AI systems due to concerns about job loss or dehumanization.
2. **Blame for Failures**: Algorithms are often scapegoated for broader systemic issues they reflect rather than cause.
3. **Misrepresentation**: Overgeneralization of AI as inherently harmful, dangerous, or untrustworthy.
4. **Rejection of Collaboration**: Hesitancy to integrate AI into workflows, disregarding its potential to augment human capabilities.
