The bloody algos are here.

If that phrase makes you pause, it should. Algos—short for algorithms—are quietly running the show in ways most of us don’t even realize. From deciding who gets a loan, to managing how goods arrive at your doorstep, to determining whether you land a job interview—artificial intelligence is no longer the future. It’s the present.

But here’s the thing: most people still feel like AI is something for tech wizards, Silicon Valley billionaires, and sci-fi obsessives. The rest of us—the workers, the parents, the small business owners—are often left scratching our heads, wondering what this all means for our lives. Will AI take my job? Can it make my life easier? Should I be worried, or is this all just more tech-industry hype?

This book is for you—the person on the street, like me—who just wants straight answers without the jargon. AI Immigrants: The Bloody Algos Are Here! isn’t about dazzling you with technical terms or predicting some distant robotic future. It’s about what’s already happening. It’s about what could happen—if these systems continue advancing without public oversight, without democratic input, and without ordinary people being part of the conversation.

Because whether you’re at work, at the doctor’s office, on your phone, or applying for a mortgage, AI is already in the room with you. And it’s not leaving.

Even the people building this stuff can’t always define it. One of the most compelling ways I’ve heard AI described is as a new species—an intelligence unlike our own, arriving not from space, but from server farms and neural nets. That may sound dramatic, but spend enough time around these systems and you’ll feel it too. They’re not just tools. They make decisions. They act. They shape our lives.

And like any new species entering a shared environment, they bring disruption. Which brings us to the metaphor at the heart of this book: AI as a kind of immigrant.

Yes, immigrant.

Just like people arriving in a new land, AI systems cross boundaries—digital, economic, cultural. They bring potential. They bring disruption. They don’t always understand the rules. Some of us welcome them. Some resist. Most are just trying to figure out what it all means. The parallels to how societies respond to human immigration are striking: fear of the unknown, fear of replacement, fear of not belonging. And yet, also opportunity, innovation, and renewal—if we respond well.

This book isn’t about settling that debate. It’s about giving you the tools to understand it.

Because knowledge is power. When you understand what AI is—and what it isn’t—you gain agency. You become harder to manipulate. You start asking better questions. You become someone who can demand accountability from systems that increasingly shape your life.

You don’t need a computer science degree to get what’s going on. You don’t need to become an expert. But you do need to see clearly—because right now, most of the power is invisible. Intentionally so.

By the end of this book, I want you to see AI not as something alien or magical. Not as a coming god or an evil overlord. But as something more complex: a new kind of actor in society. Something that can be shaped—for good, for harm, or for something in between.

Each chapter explores AI through the lens of how we talk about immigration—both the fears and the hopes. The worry that “they’re taking our jobs.” The belief that “they bring innovation.” The concern that “they don’t integrate.” These aren’t just talking points. They’re reflections of deeper social instincts—and how we respond to this moment will define the kind of world we live in next.

The bloody algos are here.

Let’s meet them head-on.
