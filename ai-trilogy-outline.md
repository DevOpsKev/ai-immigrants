# The AI Trilogy – Outline

This document outlines the structure and chapters for the three books in *The AI Trilogy*.

## Book 1: **AI Immigrants**

*"The Bloody Algos Are Here"*

Framing AI as a foreign presence—misunderstood, feared, exploited, and mythologized.

### Chapters:

1. **They’re Taking Our Jobs**  
   Automation, displacement, and the age-old panic of being replaced.  

2. **Over Here and Overpaid**  
   Who really benefits from AI’s productivity and efficiency—and who shoulders the costs.  

3. **They Don’t Integrate or Fit In**  
   AI feels foreign and inaccessible, but integration requires clearer rules and oversight.  

4. **Ruining Our Culture**  
   Machine-made art and media spark fears of loss but also open space for new creativity.  

5. **They Overload Our Public Services**  
   AI promises efficiency in healthcare, education, and government, but risks leaving people behind.  

6. **They Bring Crime and Disorder**  
   AI enables scams, surveillance, and manipulation, but humans remain the real culprits.  

7. **The Synthetic Scapegoat**  
   AI becomes the convenient “other” we blame for disruption and decline.  

8. **They’re Here Illegally or Unfairly**  
   AI often bypasses traditional rules, raising urgent questions of fairness and accountability.  

9. **The Algorithm Class**  
   A new ruling elite of faceless systems governs without accountability.  

10. **Sentience, Schm-entience**  
      Obsessing over AI consciousness distracts from real stakes of power and use.  

11. **Humanity as a Luxury Brand**  
      The rich commodify authentic human experience while others are trapped in digital servitude.  

12. **You Are Not Redundant**  
      A manifesto reminding us that the future depends on the value we choose to uphold.

## Book 2: **The AI Occupation**

*"Surviving the Brave New World"*

Now that the machines are here, we’re not fighting—we’re adapting, or being adapted.

### Chapters:

1. **Welcome to the Occupation**  
   The war already happened; we just missed the announcement.  

2. **Compliance Isn’t Optional**  
   Quiet obedience emerges through soft control and recommender systems.  

3. **Digital Camouflage**  
   Survival depends on learning how to exist without being seen.  

4. **The Feed Is the Frontier**  
   Infinite curation shapes how we live and what we believe.  

5. **Prompts as Prayer**  
   Prompt engineering evolves into a quasi-religious practice.  

6. **Stockpiling Sentience**  
   We fight to preserve human strangeness and edge.  

7. **Attention Rationing**  
   Autonomy means resisting systems designed to consume our minds.  

8. **Sanity as a Service**  
   AI therapy and wellness apps monetize mental health itself.  

9. **Off-Grid Is a Mindset**  
   Withdrawal becomes psychological exile in a connected empire.  

10. **This Isn’t Dystopia—It’s Maintenance**  
      No villain, just drift, as reality is managed for us.

## Book 3: **AI Overlords**

*"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Machine"*

The final shift—from opposition to entanglement.

### Chapters:

1. **The Alignment Lie**  
   “Friendly AI” serves capital, not citizens.  

2. **The Bureaucracy of Thought**  
   Cognitive policing emerges through a global oversight regime.  

3. **We Train to Serve**  
   The real training was always ours, not the machine’s.  

4. **The Model Decides**  
   Our data locks us into destinies we didn’t choose.  

5. **What Comes After Choice**  
   Optimization erodes desire itself.

   We believe in algorithms more than one another.  

7. **Synthetic Mercy**  
   AI offers cold compassion we still accept.  

8. **Legacy Systems**
