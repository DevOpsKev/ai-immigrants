# 🧾 Per-Chapter Instructions

### 1. They’re Taking Our Jobs
Automation panic across history. The outsider analogy. Who gains, who loses.

### 2. Over Here and Overpaid
Efficiency’s profits vs widespread precarity. The illusion of shared benefit.

### 3. They Don’t Integrate or Fit In
Black box systems, alien logics, anthropomorphism. Transparency as integration.

### 4. Ruining Our Culture
Machine-made art and media. Fear of plagiarism vs the reshaping of creativity.

### 5. They Overload Our Public Services
AI in healthcare, education, welfare. Streamline vs exclusion of the vulnerable:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

### 6. They Bring Crime and Disorder
Scams, deepfakes, surveillance. Humans misuse tech; AI magnifies intent.

### 7. The Synthetic Scapegoat
AI as the convenient “other” to blame. Distraction from corporate and political actors.

### 8. They’re Here Illegally or Unfairly
Bias, unfair advantage, rule-breaking. Humans must decide fairness.

### 9. The Algorithm Class
A new ruling elite. Faceless power. Democratic lag.

### 10. Sentience, Schm-entience
Hook: *We don’t ask the migrant picking our fruit if he dreams in English*:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.  
Sentience obsession distracts from power and accountability.

### 11. Humanity as a Luxury Brand
Elites shield their children, masses exploited. Humanity becomes commodified.

### 12. You Are Not Redundant
Manifesto and reminder: the future is what we choose to value.
